- **Day/night cycle** - 🌙☀️ Different challenges at different times
- **Seasonal events** - 🎃🎄🎆 Limited-time levels with special emojis

**Progression Hooks:**
- Unlock new emoji characters every few levels
- "Emoji collection" - Gotta catch 'em all mentality  
- Customize your launcher with different emoji styles
- Boss battles using big emojis like 🐉🦅🔱

**Social Features:**
- Share your high scores with emoji reactions

The key is making it **visually appealing with chunky, satisfying destruction**, **easy to pick up but hard to put down**, and giving players **constant small rewards** to keep them coming back!
